randomuser's dotfiles
=====================

here's some dotfiles!

some features

- ``bspwm`` + ``sxhkd``
- ``tmenu``: terminal based ``dmenu`` replacement
- uses ``pash``, the password manager
- no flakes (can't figure it out, lol)

some future things to work on are

- remove ``polybar`` with a simpler, homegrown solution
- integrate a dynamic color switching mechanism
	- make these more appealing, in general
	- without compromising speed and system load
- compatibility with 'traditional' unix systems

license.

- boring legal stuff for most items in this configuration are in the LICENSE file.
	- under the GPLv3
	- everything under ``config/*``, ``builds/*``, and ``modules/*``, in addition to all files that are ``*.nix``.
	- NOT in ``wallpapers/*``, those are unlicensed and their legal status is unknown
