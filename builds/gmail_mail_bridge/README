synchronize email from gmail accounts whose OAuth access is heavily restricted

background
----------

my school district disabled external OAuth access to email, which is not cool. this script gets around this and creates a bridge so you can recieve emails from your school email.

do note that this is heavily unpolished and most definately insecure. there are some hardcoded credentials (which you can change, it just takes a little technical know-how)

have fun!
